# Method:

## Preprocessing

### Step 1: Data-Preprocessing on Pfam ~ 1h

1. General folder processing + description ~ 3min
2. PID computing ~ 45min
3. Clustering > 99% + description ~ 5min
4. Data split (50% train/50% test) ~ 2s

###Â Step 2: Example-Preprocessing on half Pfam ~ 50min

> must be done for Pfam_TRAIN and Pfam_TEST

> up to 6 successive contextual amino-acids in one direction,
and with pid between 40 and 50%

1. Selection of valid example positions ~ 3min
2. Store the valid examples ~ 45min
3. Store the fraction of examples per seed ~ 2min



## Training Phase

> up to 6 successive contextual amino-acids in one direction,
and with pid between 40 and 50%

### Step 3.1: Table 2D computing ~ 1h

(7 pseudo-counters evaluated)

1. 2D counts: ~ 1h
2. 2D version frequencies, probabilities with pseudo-counters and scores ~ 0.01 s
3. Visualisation 2D tables ~ 10s

### Step 3.2: Table 3D count ~ 1h40min

1. 3D counts: ~ 1h40min

### Step 3.3: Table 3D versions ~ 0.4s

1. 3D frequencies ~ 0.04 s
2. 3D probabilities with pseudo-counters ~ 0.34 s

### Step 4: Example TRAIN/TEST selection ~ 6min

> 1 million examples selected

1. Store random examples TRAIN/TEST (repetition allowed) ~ 6min

### Step 5: Pseudo-counter selection

> Brier with naive Bayes with each pseudo-counter tested

1. Selection of pseudo-counter 2D + Visualisation:  + 
2. Selection of pseudo-counter 3D with one contextual amino acid (uni) ~ 45min
3. Selection of pseudo-counter 3D with multiple contextual amino acids (multi) ~ 55min
4. Visualisation of pseudo-counter 3D uni/multi: /



## Testing Phase

### Step 6: Brier with naive Bayes

> pseudo-counters 2D and 3D fixed according to the results of step 5

1. Brier Score test computing with one contextual amino acid (uni) + Visualisation ~ 5min (one test) + 
1. Brier Score computing with multiple contextual amino acids (multi) + Visualisation
